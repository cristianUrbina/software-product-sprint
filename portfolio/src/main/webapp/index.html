          Since elementary school I have been interested in participating in each
          contest related to maths. In 2013, I participated in the "Olympiad of 
          children's knowledge" at a national level and I was part of the 52 children who
          represented Veracruz.
      </p>
      <p>
          I think that it was the most important thing in my life, because from that I became
          a competitive person, I love being involved in contests as I said. 
      </p>
      <p>
          The contest where I've been involved the most is Mathematical Olympiads, from 
          middle school to high school. I strongly believe that it was the main thing
          that developed my skills and my profesional path, because as a consequence
          of it I chose to change my university degree from mechatronics to CS. Being 
          a computer scientist was a new oportunity to me to continue using and developing
          skills that Mathematical Olympiads gave me.

          I've been enroled in competitive programming for almost a year.
          The last topic I've been working on is dynamic programming.
