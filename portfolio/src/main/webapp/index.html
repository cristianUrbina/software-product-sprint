      Hi, my name is Cristian Omar Urbina Herrera. I am a CS student at the 
      Instituto Tecnol√≥gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey.
      I have been interested in competitive programming for a year and lately 
      in muisic theory.

    <p>
      Since elementary school I have been interested in participating in each
      contest related to maths. In 2013, I participated in the "Olympiad of 
      children's knowledge" at a national level and I was part of the 52 children who
      represented Veracruz.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think that it was the most important thing in my life, because from that I became
      a competitive person, I love being involved in contests as I said. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The contest where I've been involved the most is Mathematical Olympiads, from 
      middle school to high school. I strongly believe that it was the main thing
      that developed my skills and my profesional path, because as a consequence
      of it I chose to change my university degree from mechatronics to CS. Being 
      a computer scientist was a new oportunity to me to continue using and developing
      skills that Mathematical Olympiads gave me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been enroled in competitive programming for almost a year.
      The last topic I've been working on is dynamic programming.

        <span class = "ProjectTitle">Automatic Elevator for Industry</span>
        <p>
          A common elevator that performs the tasks of carry burdens to different levels in a factory.
          It consists of a PIC 16F84A and an Arduino One working together and making decisions based 
          on input data, wich is collected by sensors, and controlling the logical behavior of the motor.
          <ul>
            <li>Designed the logical circuit.</li>
            <li>Programed the code in C language for PIC Microcontroller.</li>
            <li>Gave feedback to the Arduino programmer.</li>
